# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction App

## 📌 Project Overview
The Flight Price Prediction App is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts flight ticket prices based on multiple travel-related features. The project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle, including data preprocessing, model training, and real-time deployment using Streamlit.

A trained machine learning model (`.pkl`) is used to provide instant and interactive flight price predictions through a web interface.
